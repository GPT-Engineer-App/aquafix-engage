Follow the following design principles:
- Use a Light Base: Employ a predominantly white or light-colored background to create a clean, expansive feel.
- Accent with Vibrant Colors: Choose one or two vibrant colors for highlights, buttons, and important features to draw attention and guide user interactions
- Utilize black and grey for text for clarity.
- Ensure that the layout feels open and uncluttered by generously using ample whitespace. It's okay if this means users need to scroll more; the additional space will create a more breathable and comfortable user experience. 
- Use images and icons strategically, when it compliments the website
- If necessary, design a simple, top-aligned navigation bar with clear categories, ensuring easy access and usability. Keep footer design minimal with essential links organized into categories for easy navigation.
- Hierarchical Type Setting: Use varied type sizes and weights to establish a clear visual hierarchy, helping users navigate through the content easily.
- Standout CTAs: Design call-to-action buttons with standout colors that contrast with the background, making them easy to locate.
- Emphasize Key Information: Use size, color, and placement to emphasize key pieces of information or actions.
